# Propel: An Enterprise Automation Tool 
### Project Summary
Propel is an enterprise automation tool that streamlines the process of creating infrastructure for a new application. As the product owner of this project, my goal was to reduce the previous 3-5 day process of setting up resources required for a new application.

### Project Timeline
The project took six months to complete, from initial artifact creation to handing off the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to the enterprise engineering team.

### Project Description
Our team's focus was to develop a framework that could be easily adapted by the organization as a whole. We designed templates that could be customized and managed by each system team, enabling them to define and manage their own best practices tailored to their workflows and requirements. The infrastructure resources that we automated included the creation of a GitHub repository, CircleCI pipelines, Terraform YAML files, and application information records.

Throughout the project's lifecycle, I performed various tasks to ensure its successful delivery, such as negotiating deliverables in usable intervals, delegating coding and testing of deliverables to the team during sprints, updating developers on deliverables through emails, demonstrations, and user acceptance testing, and delivering metrics before, after, and at each phase of the integration, as applicable.
