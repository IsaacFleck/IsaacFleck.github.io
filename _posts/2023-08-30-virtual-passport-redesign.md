# Virtual Passport Modernization  
### Project Summary
The goal of this project was to modernize an old application used by the business to track team member progress for several initiatives. The application was hosted on a soon-to-be-decommissioned server, and the objective was to move it to EKS in AWS. The project was also used as a training program for several interns who had just joined the company.

### Project Timeline
There was no defined timeline for the project, as it was used as a training opportunity for the interns.

### Project Description
Throughout the project, I was able to train the interns on the development process and the SDLC within the FoC. Additionally, I worked with them to design a new application architecture and walked them through the agile ceremonies implemented in our department.

Some of the common tasks that I performed over the course of the project included:

- Reviewing current business requirements, setting up acceptance criteria, and defining the final vision.
- Creating a modern application architecture utilizing AWS EKS to host the application's front end, API, and connect to the existing on-prem database.
- Creating agile artifacts detailing work for the development team to deliver.
- Managing data collection and improving the automated import process.
- Handling communication and expectations with business stakeholders.
