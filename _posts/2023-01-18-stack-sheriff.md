# Stack Sheriff - Stack Exchange Article Management tool 
### Project Summary
The objective of this project was to create a tool that could track and validate the relevance of Stack Exchange articles. This tool was intended to be used to create training materials for the business and our Tier 1 support group, thereby decreasing the number of escalations our Engineers had to handle during their on-call shift.

### Project Timeline
This was an additional task that I took on to improve the lives of engineers within the department, so there was no specific timeline for the project.

### Project Description
Here are some key points about the project:
- Developed an application written in Python to assist in the management of internal Stack Exchange (SE) articles.
- Gathered data through SE's API at timed intervals.
- Written in an object-oriented structure to allow other teams to implement the solution.
- Managed articles using tags to enable easy searching and management by the owning development team.

#### Skills and Technologies
