# AWS Account Migrations

As the Product Owner overseeing the project, I successfully migrated AWS resources for each Release Train from a centralized account to their own account. This allowed the SRE team to manage resources more effectively and track spending more efficiently.

## Project Timeline
The project timeline was 2-3 months.

## Project Description
During the project timeline, I worked closely with each team and their architect to:

- Identify requirements and acceptance criteria
- Determine optimal migration timing

I created Agile artifacts to guide the SRE team through weekly sprints and performed UAT testing to ensure functionality was maintained after the migration. In addition, I:

- Delivered technology-wide communications regarding the migration
- Performed triage duties in the event of an incident
- Employed risk management strategies to navigate potential obstacles and keep the project on track

#### Skills and Technologies
This project required a variety of skills and technologies, including:

- **Project management**: I kept the project on track by setting clear goals and timelines, monitoring progress, and communicating effectively with stakeholders.
- **Agile artifact creation**: My Agile artifacts helped the SRE team to stay organized and focused during weekly sprints.
- **Time management**: I was able to complete the project within the designated timeframe by efficiently managing my time and resources.
- **Risk management and mitigation**: My risk management strategies helped us to identify potential obstacles and develop plans to mitigate them.
- **Python (Data Aggregation)**: I used Python for data aggregation to streamline the migration process.

## Conclusion

Overall, successful migration resulted in more efficient resource management and spending tracking for the SRE team. If you're considering a similar project, be sure to prioritize clear communication, risk management, and efficient use of time and resources.
